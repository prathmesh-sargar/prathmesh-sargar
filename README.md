## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Full-Stack Engineer** with hands-on experience in **building and deploying end-to-end web applications** using the MERN stack, with practical exposure to **Docker, AWS EC2, and CI/CD workflows**.

I’m not just writing code — I care about:
- stability
- maintainability
- deployment
- and how things behave in production

🎯 **Actively seeking internship / junior full-stack opportunities** where I can contribute from day one.
